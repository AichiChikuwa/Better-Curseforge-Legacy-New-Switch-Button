# Better Curseforge Legacy/New Switch Button by Aichi_Chikuwa

## Overview

This userscript enhances the "Change to Legacy/New Site" button on CurseForge by redirecting to the corresponding page on the legacy or new site, rather than the homepage.

## Features

- Redirects "Change to Legacy/New Site" button to the current page on the corresponding site version.
- Handles both www.curseforge.com and legacy.curseforge.com URLs.
- Also Removes the (useless) "Surprise me" button and "Get CurseForge App" button on www.curseforge.com.
- Monitors URL changes and updates the button accordingly, then automatically updates the button text to indicate the correct site version.
